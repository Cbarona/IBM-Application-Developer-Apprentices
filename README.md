# IBM-Application-Developer-Apprentices
Additional learning resources for IBM Application Developer Apprentices.
 
This repository is designed to allow fellow apprentices to contribute in an open and accepting learning environment.
 
Please feel free to contribute to this repository if you want to share any supplemental material that compliments the apprentice learning path and to the benefit of those in your cohort.
 
All are welcome to participate, even those outside of the apprenticeship.
If you are an aspiring developer and are looking for a place to start learning this is the place to be. Seasoned developers are encouraged to participate as well if they have some resources that they'd like to contribute.
